e.java

	Game(): the constructor was not tested since the only fields that are initialised by the constructor
	are set as private. The only test that could have been done on those fields is to check that they are 
	not null anymore. But that cannot be done since they are not public.

	getMap(): this is a simple getter method and there is no purpose in testing it. 

	generateHTMLFiles(): no need for test since to check whether its working, you only have to find if the amount of players in game is equal to the amount of files created by this function

Player.java

	Player(): the constructor was not tested for the same reason the Game() contructor was not tested.
	
	getInitial(), getMap(): was not tested because it is a simple getter.

Cell.java
	
	Cell(): the constructor was not tested for the same reason the Game() contructor was not tested.

HTMLBuilder.java
	
	HTMLBuilder(): the constructor was not tested for the same reason the Game() contructor was not tested.

	writeMaptToFile(): no need to test it since it produced an html file which could be inspectioned if an error occured. If the file could not be opened, the error would be caught through exception handling.

Map.java
	
	getCopyOfMap(): was not tested since it only physically produced a copy of a 2d array

	getTreusurePos(): was not tested since its only a getter

	visitCoord(): was not tested since it only changed one attribatue of a Cell (too simple to test)

Position.java

	No tests were produced for all of the methods of this class since it only contains setters and getters

Type.java
	
	No tests for this class since its an enum class
